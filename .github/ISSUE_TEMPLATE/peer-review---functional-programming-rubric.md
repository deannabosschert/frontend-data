## Legenda
- ✅: voldoende

- 〽️: aanvulling

- ❓: geen idee

- ❌: nog niet voldoende


## ✅ Application of subject matter
[write here what I still need to fix, tips or tops]

### 1-2
-  ✅ Git, is used   
-  ✅ The project runs without errors     
-  ✅ Data is loaded with d3     
-  ✅ There is a representation of data  

#### ✅ 3-4
- Data is rendered with d3
- Interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the data itself

#### 5-6
- ✅ Functional patterns are used to clean and transform data.

#### 7-8
- ❓ Representation and use of d3 go beyond an example.
- ✅ Code is set up in a modular way and has no unexpected side effects

#### 9-10
- ❓😱 The way the student applies subject matter is more advanced than what they were taught in class; let’s switch places
